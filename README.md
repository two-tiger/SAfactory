**SAfactory is a scalable infrastructure for agent evaluation, trajectory collection, and reinforcement learning training. It schedules agents and benchmark environments as external runtimes, routes model calls through a session-aware OpenAI-compatible Gateway, records trajectories, and feeds completed rollouts into training systems such as Slime.**

## <a id="why-safactory"></a>✨ Why SAfactory

SAfactory provides one unified workflow for agent onboarding, benchmark onboarding, evaluation, rollout data generation, and RL training.

The core runtime contract is:

- one dataset row becomes one scheduled episode;
- each episode gets its own `session_id` and Gateway session;
- the runtime calls the target model through the Gateway;
- the runtime returns one JSON result;
- `rule_evaluator.py` converts runtime output and trajectory data into the SAfactory format;
- completed trainable trajectories can be consumed by the RL Buffer Server or persisted as reusable data assets.

## <a id="agent-skill"></a>🧩 Agent Skill Quick Start

This repository includes a lightweight Agent skill that helps an Agent onboard a benchmark and run a minimal evaluation through the standard workflow:

```text
skills/safactory-workflows/SKILL.md
```

This skill currently covers onboarding a new benchmark and running a minimal single-case evaluation in Docker or RJob mode.

### <a id="benchmark-onboarding-prompt"></a>Benchmark Onboarding Prompt

Before onboarding, prepare:

1. Prepare **1–2 test cases** and make sure the benchmark's native single-case command works independently.
2. Choose the mode to onboard: `docker` (local image) or `rjob` (cluster RJob).
3. Prepare and provide the Agent with:

   - environment name;
   - local benchmark source path or link;
   - path to the test dataset;
   - the native single-case command, or the corresponding section in the benchmark README;
   - an accessible Docker image address;
   - native benchmark result/output file path or naming rule;
   - native score/reward location, range, and pass condition.

4. We recommend filling in the provided prompt and sending it to the Agent. The Agent will inspect the benchmark source/README and SAfactory docs, then implement the adapter, configs, and evaluator.
5. The Agent runs a minimal smoke test with 1–2 cases. Onboarding is complete when the runner result JSON, native benchmark output file, Gateway trajectory, and final `0–10` reward are all present and traceable to the same case.

RJob users also need to prepare a Gateway URL. Do not use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as the Gateway address from an RJob container.

```text
Use skills/safactory-workflows to onboard the following benchmark into SAfactory.

[Execution mode] (required; choose one)
- mode: [docker / rjob]

[Benchmark]
- environment name (for example, mybench): ____________________
- benchmark source or checkout path/repository: ____________________
- dataset path: ____________________
- one dataset-row schema/field description: ____________________
- 1–2 smoke-test case IDs or dataset rows: ____________________
- native single-case benchmark command: ____________________
- if the command is defined in a README, file and section: ____________________
- Docker image, if one already exists: ____________________

[Results and scoring]
- native benchmark result/output file path or naming rule: ____________________
- field or file containing the native score/reward: ____________________
- score/reward range, meaning, and pass condition: ____________________

[Scope]
- Start with only the 1–2 cases above.
- Implement the SAfactory adapter boundary: read the request, take
  env_params.dataset, call the model through the Gateway, invoke the existing
  native single-case command, read its result, and return a
  SimulationStartResult JSON object.
- Do not rewrite the benchmark single-case execution or evaluation logic
  already inside the Docker image.
- Report and verify the runner result JSON, native benchmark output file,
  Gateway trajectory, and final 0–10 reward.

First inspect the benchmark source/README and
docs/guides/custom-environment.md, then edit the files required by the selected
mode. If information is missing, ask only for that field; do not guess the
benchmark command or scoring rule.
```

</details>

The Agent owns the SAfactory adapter boundary, not the benchmark's internal single-case logic. See [Custom Environments](docs/guides/custom-environment.md) and the skill's [integration reference](skills/safactory-workflows/references/environment-integration.md) for file responsibilities, the runner/result contract, and Docker/RJob differences.

When you use this skill, the Agent reads `docs/guides/`, `docs/reference/`, and the root README as needed, using the standard `env/geo3k/` environment as its reference implementation. You only need to provide the benchmark information listed above; if your Agent cannot discover local skills automatically, include `skills/safactory-workflows/` explicitly in the prompt.

## <a id="quick-start"></a>🚀 Quick Start

### 1. SAfactory Installation And Gateway Configuration

Before running Geo3K, prepare the runtime image and dataset as described in [Standard Environment: Geo3K](docs/reference/environments.md#standard-environment-geo3k).

Install SAfactory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI45Lab/SAfactory.git
cd SAfactory
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

Docker must be available locally, and the current user must be able to run `docker build`, `docker run`, and `docker exec`.

Create a local Gateway config:

```bash
cp gateway/config.example.yaml gateway/config.local.yaml
```

Edit `gateway/config.local.yaml` and explicitly set the storage path and model route:

```yaml
listen_host: 0.0.0.0
listen_port: 8000
base_session_path: /v1/sessions
max_steps: -1

storage_type: sqlite
storage_config:
  db_url: sqlite://env_trajs.db

llm_routes:
  geo3k_model:
    base_url: http://YOUR_LLM_HOST/v1
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    supports_stream: true
    max_concurrency: 64
```

Start the Gateway:

```bash
python -m gateway --config gateway/config.local.yaml
```

Check readiness from another terminal:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/readyz
```

When using Cloud storage, the recommended configuration is to omit
`landing_table` and `env_config_table` from the Gateway YAML and set only one
profile in `.env`:

```bash
WT_SDK_PROFILE=test
```

or:

```bash
WT_SDK_PROFILE=production
```

The `test` profile selects `landing_test` and `env_config_test`; the
`production`/`prod` profile selects `wind_tunnel_landing` and
`evaluation_env_config`. This keeps trajectory and environment-config writes
in the same environment. Explicit table names in `storage_config` override the
profile and should be used only for intentional special cases. SAfactory does
not access the serving table.

### 2. Minimal Evaluation With Geo3K

Run a minimal Geo3K evaluation in Docker mode:

```bash
python launcher.py \
  --mode docker \
  --agent-config env/geo3k/geo3k_config.yaml \
  --agent-start-config env/geo3k/geo3k_start.yaml \
  --gateway-base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/sessions \
  --llm-model geo3k_model \
  --enable-evaluation \
  --db-path sqlite://env_trajs.db \
  --job-id geo3k-docker-smoke \
  --pool-size 1 \
  --max-workers 1 \
  --max-steps 10
```

`--llm-model` must match a key under `llm_routes`. With `--enable-evaluation`, SAfactory calls `env/geo3k/rule_evaluator.py` and writes the final reward.

### 3. Minimal Training With Geo3K

Geo3K training uses the RL bridge under `rl/` and the example config at `rl/examples/geo3k_vl/env.sh`.

Before starting, edit `rl/examples/geo3k_vl/env.sh`, or export the same variables in each terminal. Set the required local paths and scale the first run down:

```bash
export AIEVOBOX_ROOT=$(pwd)
export AIEVOBOX_MODE=docker
export AIEVOBOX_AGENT_CONFIG=${AIEVOBOX_ROOT}/env/geo3k/geo3k_config.yaml
export AIEVOBOX_AGENT_START_CONFIG=${AIEVOBOX_ROOT}/env/geo3k/geo3k_start.yaml
export AIEVOBOX_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1
export AIEVOBOX_GATEWAY_PORT=8000
export RL_MODEL=geo3k_model
export AIEVOBOX_POOL_SIZE=2
export RL_GROUP_SIZE=2
export RL_EPOCH=1
export HF_CKPT_DIR=/path/to/hf-checkpoint
export SLIME_HOME=/path/to/slime
export MEGATRON_HOME=/path/to/Megatron-LM
```

Then start two processes from the repository root:

```bash
RL_ENV_SH=rl/examples/geo3k_vl/env.sh bash rl/run_slime_generator.sh
```

```bash
RL_ENV_SH=rl/examples/geo3k_vl/env.sh bash rl/run_buffer_server.sh
```

Rewards for RL training come from completed trajectories in the database: `rule_evaluator.py` writes the reward after evaluation, and Buffer Server fetches trajectory rows with rewards from the same database used by Launcher / Gateway before serving them to the training process.

Buffer Server can automatically start a Gateway and route `RL_MODEL` to the Slime-hosted LLM proxy. If a manually started Gateway is already using the same port, stop it first. Set `AIEVOBOX_GATEWAY_AUTOSTART=0` only when the external Gateway already has the correct route and storage configuration.
